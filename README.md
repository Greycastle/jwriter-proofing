# Proof reading tool

This is a small tool for [JWriter](https://japapps.com) proof-readers to help them annotate articles with what was updated.

It as a prefilled example so you can load it just as is but, it is wired up to an Airtable backend to load articles from.

To avoid storing any sensitive data in this repo, the api key and article id is passed in through the URL. This is also far from great as it an be sniffed way too easily but, for now it will do. Later I intend to read this API key from a configuration store once a user is logged in.
